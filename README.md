# MCU-51
STC89C51 is the first MCU that I just contact with embedded industry. Because I was just exposed to this part of the content, I didn't understand it very well, so I used the development board of Puzhong at the beginning of learning, and my thinking was not very clear at the beginning of learning. I just ran an experiment myself, and then summarized it. When I got to a certain experimental experience, I collected the contents of the previous study, and finally made a comprehensive project.

This part mainly includes some routines and related notes I learned from the development board of Puzhong, for reference of relevant personnel!

STC89C51是我刚刚接触嵌入式行业玩的最早的一款MCU。因为我刚刚接触该部分内容，不是很了解，所以一开始使用的是普中的开发板，刚开始学习时思路也不是很明确，就是自己跑一个实验，然后总结一下，当到达一定的实验经验时将前面学习的内容汇集，最终做成一个综合的项目。
该部分主要包含了我学习普中开发板的一些例程以及相关的笔记，供相关人员参考！

该库暂且包含以下几个文件夹：
